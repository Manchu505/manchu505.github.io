        <h2>What are Web Applications?</h2>
        <!-- <h2> tag defines a secondary heading. -->

        <p>Web applications, often referred to as web apps, are interactive programs that run on a web server and are accessed through a web browser over the internet. Unlike traditional desktop applications that are launched by your operating system, web apps must be accessed through a web interface. They provide functionality such as interacting with users, connecting to back-end databases, and generating results to browsers. This makes web applications highly accessible across various devices and operating systems, which contributes to their popularity.</p>
        <!-- <p> tags define paragraphs. This paragraph describes what web applications are. -->

        <p>Web apps range from simple applications like message boards or guest sign-in pages to complex software applications like project management tools or interactive gaming platforms. They are built using a combination of server-side scripts (like PHP and ASP) to handle the storage and retrieval of information, and client-side scripts (like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) to present information to users. This dual-script approach allows web applications to be both dynamic and interactive, making them an essential part of modern web technology.</p>
        <!-- Another paragraph that describes different types of web applications and how they are built. -->
    </section>

    <!-- Additional sections can be similarly commented, explaining what each part does and how it relates to the overall function of the web application. -->
    <section id="database-interaction">
        <h2>Interaction with Back-End Databases</h2>
        <p>Web applications interact with back-end databases primarily to store, retrieve, update, and delete data dynamically. This interaction is facilitated by a server-side script written in languages such as PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java. These scripts execute database queries and operations based on user requests and actions performed on the web interface.</p>

        <p>When a user interacts with a web application (for example, by submitting a form), the client-side portion of the application (running in the user's browser) sends a request to the server. The server-side script processes this request, formulating a SQL query or a command that is sent to the database. The database processes this query and returns the results back to the server script. Then, the server-side script processes these results and sends the appropriate data back to the client, often in the form of HTML or JSON, which updates the user interface accordingly.</p>

        <p>This continuous cycle of requests and updates is what allows web applications to offer dynamic content that changes based on user interaction, making them highly interactive and responsive to user needs. The database is the central repository for the applicationâ€™s data, making its design and management crucial for the performance and reliability of the application.</p>
